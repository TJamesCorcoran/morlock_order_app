Read the PDFs on a desktop computer
-----------------------------------
Open the links, one at a time, in a web browser, and
then either right-click and select "save as", or type Control-S.

You can use Adobe Acrobat ( available free at
https://get.adobe.com/reader/ ) or Evince ( available free at
https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince/Downloads ).


Read the PDFs on a tablet
---------------------------

Using your tablet, use a webbrowser to open the links, one at a time.
The web broswer will offer to save the files.  On a Nexus use the
built in PDF viewer (
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.pdfviewer&hl=en
)

On an iPad use Adobe Acrobat (
